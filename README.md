# Python to CPython

**Python to CPython** is a tool designed to convert simple Python code into CPython to achieve better performance and speed. This project translates Python code into C code compatible with CPython, which can then be compiled into a Python extension module.

## Features

- Convert Python functions to C functions
- Compile generated C code into a CPython module
- Benchmark performance improvements

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- A C compiler (e.g., `gcc`, `clang`)

### Set Up the Project

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/python-to-cpython.git
   cd python-to-cpython
